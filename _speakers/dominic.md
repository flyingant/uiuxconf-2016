bio: "Dominic is heading the Bosch internal design and innovation agency, Bosch User Experience (UX), here in Shanghai. He joined Bosch UX at the start of 2012 in Stuttgart, Germany. In Stuttgart he was mainly working on designing as well as prototyping simple and interactive user-centered solutions across the whole range of Bosch products. With his move to Shanghai, China in 2014, he could then combine his passion for creating new design concepts with his other passion for China, its culture and language.
 
Before joining Bosch, Dominic completed his Master with focus on Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Canterbury (New Zealand). While studying in Christchurch, he worked as tennis coach at different tennis clubs as well as interaction designer at Civil and Natural Resources Engineering. Prior to moving to New Zealand he lived in China for a couple years, where he mainly studied Chinese (Mandarin).<br/>
 
Apart from his passion for design and China, you can find Dominic traveling the world or just around the next corner on a rugby pitch."
